Everyone knows the [Conway's Game of
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). And at least some
are familiar with [Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org/).

At the apres-SCNA2011(http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) code retreat,
Zach (https://github.com/zdsbs) and [I](https://github.com/verdammelt) joked
that someone should do the Game of Life in BASH.  This elicited many groans
and shudders (from ourselves included).

So of course when we paired together at the last session we decided to try it.
We didn't get very far but had lots of fun and decided that we could not let
this horrible idea die.

Maybe someday we'll move this project along; maybe someday at some future code
retreat we'll show it off as a curiosity.
